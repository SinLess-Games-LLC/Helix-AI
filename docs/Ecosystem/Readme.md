# Helix Ecosystem Overview

The Helix ecosystem is designed to provide a robust, scalable, and secure environment for the development, deployment, and monitoring of applications. This document outlines how various components within the Helix ecosystem are routed and utilized.

## Logging and Monitoring

In the Helix ecosystem, comprehensive logging and monitoring are critical for maintaining system health and diagnosing issues.

### Logging

- **Fluentd** acts as the central logging aggregator, collecting logs from various services.
- Logs are routed from Fluentd to two primary destinations:
  - **Elasticsearch**: Logs stored here can be queried and analyzed.
  - **Prometheus**: Metrics from logs are extracted for monitoring.

### Monitoring

- **Kibana** provides a user-friendly interface to visualize and search through logs stored in Elasticsearch.
- **Grafana** offers powerful dashboards and alerting by visualizing metrics stored in Prometheus.

## API Gateway and Service Discovery

The Helix ecosystem utilizes a combination of API Gateway and Service Discovery to efficiently route requests and manage services.

- **KrakenD** serves as the API Gateway, efficiently routing incoming requests to the appropriate backend services.
- **Consul** is used for service discovery, ensuring that services are easily located and communication between them is optimized.

## Secrets Management

Security is paramount in the Helix ecosystem. To safeguard sensitive information:

- **Vault** is employed to manage and securely store secrets.
- **Age** and **SOPS** are used to encrypt secrets, ensuring that even if they are exposed, they remain protected.

## Message Broker

Message brokers are crucial for handling asynchronous communication between services. In the Helix ecosystem:

- **Kafka** and **Zookeeper** are utilized as the primary message brokers.
- These tools manage the queuing and transfer of data and tasks between various services, ensuring reliable and scalable inter-service communication.

## Databases

Depending on the needs of different services, the Helix ecosystem uses multiple types of databases:

- **MySQL**, **MongoDB**, and **PostgreSQL** are employed where applicable, offering flexibility and optimization for various types of data storage requirements.

## Third-Party SaaS Integrations

The Helix ecosystem integrates with several third-party SaaS tools to enhance functionality and streamline operations:

- **GitHub**: Used for version control and CI/CD through GitHub Actions.
- **Cloudflare**: Provides DNS and security services.
- **Discord**: Utilized for bot communication, alerts, and team collaboration.
- **Sentry**: Monitors and tracks application errors.
- **Mend (Renovate)**: Automates dependency updates.
- **Google Analytics**: Tracks and analyzes user interactions with web applications.
- **Stripe** and **PayPal**: Handle payment processing.
