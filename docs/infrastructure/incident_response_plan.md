## Incident Response Process:

1. **Detection:** Incidents can be detected through monitoring tools, user reports, or automated alerts.
2. **Identification:** Once an incident is detected, the team leader verifies the incident, determines its severity level, and assigns it to a developer for resolution.
3. **Containment:** The developer works to contain the incident, minimizing its impact on users and services.
4. **Resolution:** The developer resolves the incident, restores services to normal operation, and verifies that the issue is fully resolved.
5. **Communication:** Throughout the incident response process, the team leader communicates with stakeholders, providing updates on the incident and its resolution.
6. **Post-Incident Review:** After the incident is resolved, the team conducts a post-incident review to identify the root cause of the incident, determine if any preventive measures can be implemented, and document lessons learned.

## On-call Schedule:

- Developers should be scheduled for 2 days on and 1 day off to ensure adequate rest and avoid burnout.
