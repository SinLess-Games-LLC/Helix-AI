# Disaster Recovery Plan for Cluster Apps

## Overview

This document outlines the disaster recovery plan for the cluster apps deployed in the Kubernetes cluster. The plan includes strategies for handling both planned and unplanned outages, backup and restore procedures, and testing methodologies to ensure the recoverability of the apps.

## Outage Response

### Planned Outages

- **Purpose:** To test the cluster's response to controlled downtime and ensure the viability of the disaster recovery plan.
- **Procedure:** Scheduled maintenance windows will be used to simulate planned outages, during which services will be gracefully shut down and then restored to assess recovery capabilities.
- **Chaos Engineering:** Chaos Mesh will be used to introduce controlled chaos into the cluster during planned outages, allowing for the testing of various failure scenarios and the validation of the cluster's resilience and recovery mechanisms.

### Unplanned Outages

- **Definition:** Any unforeseen event or Chaos Engineering, that causes a disruption in service availability.
- **Response:** The team will follow the incident response plan to quickly diagnose the issue, mitigate any impact, and restore services using the backup data. Chaos Mesh can also be used to analyze the impact of the unplanned outage and validate the effectiveness of the [incident response plan](/docs/incident_response_plan.md).
- **Communication:** Regular updates will be provided to stakeholders and end-users to keep them informed about the status of the outage and the progress of the recovery efforts.
- **Postmortem:** After the outage is resolved, a postmortem analysis will be conducted to identify the root cause, evaluate the response, and implement any necessary improvements to prevent similar incidents in the future.

## Backup Strategy

### Backup Frequency

- **Daily Backups:** Automated backups of all cluster apps will be taken daily.
- **Retention Period:** Backup data will be retained for 7 days.
- **Weekly and Monthly Backups:** Weekly and monthly backups will be taken for long-term retention and stored securely.

### Backup Type

- **Incremental Backups:** To reduce storage and backup time, incremental backups will be used to capture changes since the last full backup.

### Backup Storage

- **On-Premises:** Backup data will be stored on-premises for quick access and restoration.
- **Amazon S3:** Additionally, backup data will be replicated to Amazon S3 for off-site storage and redundancy.

## Testing

- **Regular Testing:** Backups will be regularly tested to ensure they can be restored successfully in case of a disaster.
- **Test Scenarios:** Various scenarios, including full and partial restores, will be tested to validate the backup integrity and recovery process.

## Conclusion

This disaster recovery plan aims to ensure the availability and recoverability of the cluster apps in the event of a disaster. Regular testing and adherence to the outlined procedures are essential to maintaining the effectiveness of the plan.
